## 2.1 (2018-08-29)

All WC/AC models must include a prefix for better identification in code reviews.
Bring your own models (BYOM) => consume the api + api models but create new models for your application logic / templates.

- renamed case classes: `Menu` -> `ApiMenu`, `MenuMetadata` -> `ApiMenuMetadata` and `MenuLink` -> `ApiMenuLink`

- added new project called `menu`
- added `MenuService` for retrieving menu data from S3
- added case classes `Menu`, `MenuMetadata`, `MenuLink` and `MenuReference`

#### Breaking Changes

- Moved `AdminMenuService` to `menu` project
- Removed case classes `RawMenu` and `RawMenuLink`

## 1.8 (2018-08-02)

- added `RawChannelStageConfiguredId` as a new main stage type
- this allows single ids to be configured on section pages without the need of Papyrus Curation
- example usecases: Advertorial Footers, oEmbeds (WM, Podcasts,...)


## 1.7 (2018-06-08)

- added `AdminMenuService` for storing menu data on S3

## 1.5 (2018-05-31)

*Changes*

- introduced new `TreeService` as an abstraction to the `RawTreeService` in the front end
- Migrated the `AuthorService` from _funkotron_ into the capi to allow using it within cigger (why: _author augmenting_)
- `RawTreeService` will not access s3 when app is started in `Mode.Test`
- Play Framework version bump to `2.6.15`

*Deprecations*

- Deprecated large parts of `ApiAuthor` in favor of augmenting authors json into the `related` array of the `ApiPressedContent`

## 1.4 (2018-03-28)

- Changed signature of _cigger_ to `ApiPressedContentResponse`

## 1.2 bugfix (2018-03-16)

- definition which Exceptions will cause the breaker to stay open or allow close. e.g.
    - `HttpClientErrorException` and `HttpRedirectException` will keep the breaker closed (this is good)
    - whereas `HttpServerErrorException` and any other exception may open the breaker

## 1.2 (2017-11-27)

- introduced circuit breaker pattern in AbstractService
- Playframework 2.6.6
- Added Cigger Support

#### Breaking Changes

- AbstractService is now an `abstract class` (instead of a `trait`)
- `ExecutionContexts` should now be `@Injected` everywhere instead of being passed as `implicit` parameters 

## 1.1 (2017-07-21)

## 0.12.0 (2017-03-09)

/

## 0.11.0 (2017-02-03)
- Future proof JSON parsing
- Digger can ignore unknown new modules from CMCF
- CMCF can be rolled out with new Modules that are not yet known to Digger will be ignored

#### Changes
- added case class `RawChannelStageIgnored`

## 0.10.0 (2017-02-03)

#### Changes

- `PressedSectionService` now wraps its responses
  - the wrapper contains information about `time`, `status`, `source`, .. of the pressed result
  - those wrapped models are uploaded to S3
  - alternate treatment of backend calls when in `Dev Mode` 
- Changed logging to typesafe's scala-logging (should increase performance and reduce memory)
- minor fixes like typos  

#### Breaking

- the models in S3 and the `PressedSectionService` are now wrapped (JSON changed)

#### Migration

- the Logger automatically does the `log.isLevelEnabled()` and therefore permits calling this directly. Just remove the `if`.
- As for the wrapped JSON: You could simply unwrap it to use the previous models.

## 0.9.0 (2017-01-26)

#### Changes

- use Guice directly instead of Play's DI abstraction.

#### Breaking

- Play's DI and Guice are compatible to some extend, but you should consider using Guice's interfaces if you access the WC/AC DI-Modules directly 

#### Migration

Follow DI as described here https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaDependencyInjection

- migrate your code from `play.api.inject.Module` to `com.google.inject.AbstractModule`
- change from `def bindings(environment: Environment, configuration: Configuration): Seq[Binding[_]]
` to `protected abstract void configure()`
- for module-dependencies, use `install(m: Module)`

## 0.8.0 (2017-01-25)

#### Changes

- migrated to wrapped search endpoint that allows paginated searches

#### Breaking

- none, if migration is applied

#### Migration

- just call `searchResponse.map(_.results)` to unwrap the search result and use the old models
- update the _search_ `endpoint` in your configuration to `/content/wrapped/_search`

## 0.7.0 (2017-01-13)

#### Changes

- params for the `AbstractService` are getting trimmed now (remove leading and trailing white space) Fixes #42

#### Breaking

- type safe rewrite of the `ApiContentSearch`
- made the `RequestHeader` non `Optional`, but initialize with `Seq.empty` instead

## 0.4.0 (2016-10-18)

#### Changes

- `ContentApiQuery`
  - `flags` will be *deprecated* in favour of the new search parameter `flag`: In our API we currently only have two flags: `highlight` and `premium` and the negation of those. With the new `flag` search parameter you can combine/exclude those flags, e.g. `flag: [premium, no_highlight]` or `flag: [no_premium, no_highlight]`. The results are a conjunction of the flags (the terms are *and*ed -> `!premium && !highlight`.
  - `subTypeExcludes` (some of them formerly available through the `flags`) are moving into the `subType` search parameter, use the negated version of the corresponding subType
  - `subType` search parameter will now allow list inputs, allowing you to do things as `subType: [no_broadcast, no_video, no_printImport, no_oembed]`
- added missing default case to `ApiChannel`
